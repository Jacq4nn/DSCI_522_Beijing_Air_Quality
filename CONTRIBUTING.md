# Contributing to the Beijing Air Quality Analysis Project

We welcome feedback and proposed changes to this analysis project, as well as any bug reports and typos. Any permissible up-to-date data set upload is highly appreciated, as it will help us ensure our analysis can be amended to remain as timely as possible. The outline below indicates how to best proceed to communicate any such information.

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the *source* file.

### Dependencies

In order to ensure reproducibility and accurately identifying bugs, please be sure to review the dependencies list on the README on the project's GitHub repository, which are kept up-to-date with our analysis methodology tools.

### Prerequisites

To facilitate coordination on proposed amendments, we ask that you file an issue and reach an agreement on its relevance with someone from our team should you make a substantial pull request. If you've found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

-   We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
-   Please ensure new code follows the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org) or PEP8 [style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), thus matching our project.

### Up-to-Date Data Assessment

We strive to ensure our analysis of past trends be cognizant of more recent data collection efforts. Up-to-date source data ensures that we can deliver as timely and relevant of an analysis as we can. We commit to periodically reviewing our findings accordingly, should new credible and comprehensive data be communicated to us.

However, we ask that you please review the raw format of the original data source to ensure compatibility to our analysis methodology. Details can be found [here](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data).
