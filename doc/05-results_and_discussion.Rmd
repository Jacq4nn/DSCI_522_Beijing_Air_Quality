Figure 3. Violin Plot showing that there is a difference in median PM2.5 value in time_A and time_B

There is a difference in median values as seen in the violin plot. However, after conducting the permutation test in the difference of medians, we get a p-value of `r round(pvalue[2][[1]],3)`, which is greater than the significance level $\alpha$ = 0.05.

The result indicates that we do not have enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$. Hence, there is no statistically significant difference between the median PM2.5 measurement for time_B and time_A in Beijing.

These results illustrate that, despite increasing state attention on improving air quality across Beijing, China's relentless industrialization has not provided its urban population respite from consistently high levels of harmful PM2.5 across the metropolis.

From this analysis, we have shown that despite China's high economic growth from 2013 to 2017, it has not translated into improved PM2.5 levels [@chinagrowth]. Based on the Environmental *Keznets* Curve Hypothesis economic model, it shows that China is still on an upward trend [@dinda2004environmental].
