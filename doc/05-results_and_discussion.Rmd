## Results and Discussion

\label{sec:resultsdiscussion}

```{r load p-value, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(knitr) 
library(here)
pvalue <- read_csv(here("results", "pvalue.csv"))
```

```{r median value, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 3. Violin Plot showing that there is a difference in median PM2.5 value in time_A and time_B", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","violin_plot.png"))
```

After conducting the permutation test in the difference of medians, we get a p-value of `r round(pvalue[2][[1]],3)`, which is greater than the significance level $\alpha$ = 0.05. The violin plot highlights how close these two median values are. As seen in the plot, the orange line indicates the estimate for each time interval (`time_A` and `time_B`). 

These result answer our main question as follows: we do not have enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$. Hence, there is not enough statistical evidence to suggest that there has been a decrease in median PM2.5 measurement between time_A and time_B in Beijing, China. In other words, we conclude that PM2.5 measurements have remained unchanged or increased between these two time intervals, and have therefore at best not worsened.

The broader implications of these results illustrate that, one, the people living in Beijing will have to continue to contend with poor air quality, which will have a negative impact on their respiratory system in the long term. Two, there is much to be done by the Chinese Communitst Party (CCP) - on the state level, to address air pollution in Beijing, so as to improve their local public health situation and justify why it is capable of becoming a global leader. They need to do so not just through sheer economic and military growth, but also through supporting fundamental international regimes that are vital to the sustainability of the planet and its people - climate change and public health.
