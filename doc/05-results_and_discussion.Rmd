## Results and Discussion

\label{sec:resultsdiscussion}

```{r load p-value, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(knitr) 
library(here)
pvalue <- read_csv(here("results", "pvalue.csv"))
```

```{r median value, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 3. Violin Plot showing that there is a difference in median PM2.5 value in time_A and time_B", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","violin_plot.png"))
```

After conducting the permutation test in the difference of medians, we get a p-value of `r round(pvalue[2][[1]],3)`, which is greater than the significance level $\alpha$ = 0.05. The violin plot highlights how close these two median values are. As seen in the plot, the orange line indicates the estimate for each time interval (`time_A` and `time_B`). 

These result answer our main question as follows: we do not have enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$. Hence, there is not enough statistical evidence to suggest that there has been a decrease in median PM2.5 measurement between time_A and time_B in Beijing, China. In other words, we conclude that PM2.5 measurements have remained unchanged or increased between these two time intervals, and have therefore at best not worsened.

We did not see the improvement from our analysis result, one of the main reasons: 1. missing data 8739 / 420768 (proportion) 2.if we had more+ new data (observe from longer time period to conduct the test)
