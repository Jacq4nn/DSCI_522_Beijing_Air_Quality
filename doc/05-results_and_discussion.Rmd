## Results and Discussion

\label{sec:resultsdiscussion}

```{r load p-value, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(knitr) 
library(here)
pvalue <- read_csv(here("results", "pvalue.csv"))
```

```{r median value, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 3. Violin Plot showing that there is a difference in median PM2.5 value in time_A and time_B", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","violin_plot.png"))
```

There is a difference in median values as seen in the violin plot. However, after conducting the permutation test in the difference of medians, we get a p-value of `r round(pvalue[2][[1]],3)`, which is greater than the significance level $\alpha$ = 0.05.

These result answer our main question as follows: we do not have enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$. Hence, there is not enough statistical evidence to suggest that there has been a decrease in median PM2.5 measurement between time_A and time_B in Beijing, China. In other words, we conclude that PM2.5 measurements have remained unchanged or increased between these two time intervals, and have therefore at best not worsened.

The broader implications of these results illustrate that, despite increasing state attention on improving air quality across Beijing, China's relentless industrialization has not provided its urban population respite from consistently high levels of harmful PM2.5 across the metropolis. Despite China's high economic growth from 2013 to 2017, it has not translated into improved PM2.5 levels [@chinagrowth]. Based on the Environmental *Keznets* Curve Hypothesis economic model, it shows that China is still on an upward trend [@dinda2004environmental].
