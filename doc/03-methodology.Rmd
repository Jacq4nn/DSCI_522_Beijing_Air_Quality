We combine the data from twelve data collection stations across Beijing into one data frame and split them into the following two time frames:

-   `time_A`: PM2.5 measurements from March 2013 until February 2015 (inclusive)

-   `time_B`: PM2.5 measurements from March 2015 until February 2017 (inclusive)

We chose to divide our dataset into two equal time intervals in order to see if there is a general change in the PM2.5 levels across these two time periods. While we have considered other means of dividing the data set, such as by year and mapping it according to government policies and its implementation, we made the decision not to, as we recognise that there is a time lag for their policies to reap tangible change.

Through Exploratory Data Analysis, we identify that our data is heavily skewed to the right. As such, we determined that it is best to analyse the median of each time interval, rather than other estimates.

```

We answer the main question of this project using the following methodology pipeline. Based on the theoretical assumption that data points across both samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) when their hourly collected data are distributed over multi-year time span, we performed a hypothesis test to determine whether there is statistical evidence to indicate an improvement in PM2.5 measurements in Beijing between 2013 and 2017. To do so, we implement a one-tailed hypothesis test to answer to compare these measurements between two equal-interval time intervals (`time_A` and `time_B`).
