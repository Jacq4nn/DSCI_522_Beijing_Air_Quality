## Summary

\label{sec:summary}

In this analysis project, we aimed to answer **whether the levels of PM2.5 air pollution in Beijing, China has improved between 2013 and 2017** based on hourly PM2.5 data collected from twelve testing stations in Beijing. To do so, we performed a **one-tailed hypothesis test of independence in the medians** of two intervals, `time_A` (March 2013 - February 2015) and `time_B` (March 2015 - February 2017). The testing result only reflects the air quality trend in Beijing from 2013 to 2017, and it does not have statistically evidence to prove there is significant decrease in PM2.5 particulate measurements.
