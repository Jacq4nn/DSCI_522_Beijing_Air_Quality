### **Hypothesis Testing:**
\label{sec:analysis}

Hypothesis test for independence of a difference in medians using permutation is
a suitable test to answer our main question, given that the suitable estimator 
is median and each data point is collected independently from several testing stations and independent time unit.

-   Null Hypothesis($H_0$): The measurement of PM2.5 in Beijing from time_B does not show any sign of improvement comparing to time_A. (Point estimate of PM2.5 in time_B  $\geq$ the point estimate of PM2.5 in time_A)

-   Alternative Hypothesis($H_a$): The measurement of PM2.5 in Beijing from time_B shows an improvement comparing to time_A. (Point estimate of PM2.5 in time_B is $<$  the point estimate of PM2.5 in time_A)
