### Hypothesis Testing

\label{sec:analysis}

We use a hypothesis test for independence of a difference in medians via permutation to answer the main question main, using a significance level of $\alpha$ = 0.05.

-   Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): The median PM2.5 value in Beijing in time_A is less than or equal to the median PM2.5 value in time_B ($Q_{A}(0.5) \leq Q_{B}(0.5)$)

-   Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$): There median PM2.5 value in Beijing in time_A is greater than the median PM2.5 values in time_B ($Q_{A}(0.5) \gt Q_{B}(0.5)$)
