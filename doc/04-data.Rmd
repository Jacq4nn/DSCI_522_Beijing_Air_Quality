### **Data Wrangling:**

\label{sec:data}

We will combine data from twelve data collection stations across Beijing into 
one data frame and split them into the following two time frames:

-   $time\_A$: PM2.5 measurements from March 2013 until February 2015 
(inclusive)

-   $time\_B$: PM2.5 measurements from March 2015 until February 2017 
(inclusive)
