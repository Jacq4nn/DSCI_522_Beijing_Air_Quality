# Beijing Air Quality Analysis

-   Authors: Jacqueline Chong, Junrong Zhu, Macy Chan, Vadim Taskaev

Data analysis project for DSCI 522 (Data Science Workflows); a course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to answer the following inferential question: **Does PM2.5 measurement in Beijing, China collected between 2013 and 2017 show any sign of improvement?**

The capital city of Beijing, China has long struggled with poor air quality, a result of the country's rapid industrialization and its heavy reliance on coal for electricity generation the North, as well as its growing and increasingly urban middle class (Wang, Hao. 2012 Jan; 24(1): 2-13). This analysis question is important for its timely and global implications: as air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels and its association with climate change and direct health outcomes poses a challenge to nations worldwide, we explore whether we may find evidence of economic growth coinciding with improving air quality. In fact, in September 2021, the World Health Organization revised its air quality guidelines to more restrictive levels following the increasingly evident causal relationships between poor air quality and its harmful health consequences on impacted mainly urban communities (Whaley, Nieuwenhuijsen, Burns. 2021 Sep; 142).

We analyse the `Beijing Air Quality` data set, donated to the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository in 2019 (accessible via [URL](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data)), which comprises hourly measurement of six air pollutants (including `PM2.5`, `PM10`, `SO2`, `NO2`, `CO`, `O3`) and six meteorological variables spanning from 2013 until 2017 across twelve of its metropolitan data-collecting stations. While the structure of this data set makes it suitable for multi-variate time-series regression analysis, we focus our analysis solely on the readings of the `PM2.5` metric, a form of fine particulate matter that is considered especially harmful for its ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and cause long-lasting damage to the respiratory system (J Thorac Dis. 2016 Jan; 8(1): E69--E74).

## Methods

### Sub Exploratory Questions:

1.  How does the distribution of air quality data observations look like? Are they normally distributed?
2.  If we split the data into sub data sets based on time frames, will there be any overlap in the ranges of the samples?

In order to explore the data set while answering the sub questions, we will perform further steps as below to get better understanding for the main question.

### **Data Wrangling:**

We will combine sub data-sets, which were collected from twelve testing locations in Beijing, into one data frame, and then split this data frame into two samples based on time frames below.

-   time_A: air quality data from March 2013 - February 2015

-   time_B: air quality data from March 2015 - February 2017

### **Hypothesis Testing:**

Given that we have good sample size for both samples and the data points are independent, we will perform a hypothesis test to determine whether there is statistical evidence to indicate an improvement in PM2.5 measurements in Beijing between 2013 and year 2017. We will implement one-tailed test to answer the question since we expect to detect the improvement in PM2.5 pollution.

-   Null Hypothesis(\*H\*\<sub>0\</sub>): The measurement of PM2.5 in Beijing from time_B does not show any sign of improvement comparing to time_A. (Point estimate of PM2.5 in time_A is less than and equal to the point estimate of PM2.5 in time_B)

-   Alternative Hypothesis(*H*<sub>0</sub>): The measurement of PM2.5 in Beijing from time_B shows an improvement comparing to time_A. (Point estimate of PM2.5 in time_A is greater than the point estimate of PM2.5 in time_B)

We will perform exploratory data analysis steps to identify and demonstrate the unique patterns and distributions of PM2.5 data points for time_A and time_B data sets, and then pick the appropriate estimator from our observation to answer the inferential question on PM2.5 pollutant.

**Exploratory approaches:**

-   Creating figures, such as histogram, box-plot plot, density plot and so forth, to visualize and contrast the distribution of time_A and time_B. These plots help us to spot whether the samples are normally distributed or skewed in each data set and allow us to pick the feasible estimator.

-   Creating sub data frames, such as yearly medians/means of PM2.5 to get a general idea of the value range.

### **Results Interpretation:**

Demonstrations of the results will be in three forms, tabular data frame, labeled visualization as well as text explanation.

**examples:**

-   Outputting top rows of the imported data frame as a data set preview.

-   Highlighting test statistic values and significance threshold with shaded bar plot

-   Summarizing each figure with brief conclusion and providing insightful explanation for the observed characteristics in organized paragraphs.
